# Battleship

This is a simple implementation of battleship game in java. 
<br />Program works in CLI (Command-Line Inteface).
<br /><br />Here is .exe file:

-[Link](https://github.com/piotr-bujnowski/battleship/raw/master/exe/BattleshipWin10.exe) (win 10)

-[Link](https://github.com/piotr-bujnowski/battleship/raw/uncolorizedForWin7/exe/BattleshipWin7.exe) (win 7)

I had to split it into two version because windows 7 CMD doesn't supporrt ANSI colors,<br />so win 7 version doesn't have colors.
